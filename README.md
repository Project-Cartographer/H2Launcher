# Project_Cartographer_Launcher
A launcher used to manage Project Cartographer for Halo 2.

If you get any missing library errors just that is because the dll needed for those libraries are protected.  It contains how we generate login tokens and to prevent people who have been banned from generating new login tokens it is currently private.

Please contact me on the project cartographer discord if you need any info on this.  (supersniper#9546)
